# Axuno.VirtualFileSystem

![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/axuno/VirtualFileSystem/dotnet.yml?branch=main&label=Build%2C%20Test)

The Virtual File System makes it possible to manage files that do not exist on a physical file system (e.g. disk).

* The `VirtualFileSystem` can be extended by additional `IVirtualFileProvider`s.
* Out-of-the-box, `Microsoft.Extensions.FileProviders.Composite`, `Microsoft.Extensions.FileProviders.Embedded` and `Microsoft.Extensions.FileProviders.Physical` are integrated.
* Virtual files can be used just like static files in an application.
* JavaScript, CSS, image files and all other file types can be embedded into assemblies and used just like the static files.
* An application (or library) can override an embedded file just by placing a static file with the same name and extension into the same folder of the virtual file system.


The library is a modified version of [Volo.Abp.VirtualFileSystem](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/tree/dev/framework/src/Volo.Abp.VirtualFileSystem) 7.0
Modifications to the source code were made by axuno in 2020-23. Changes focused on:

* Decouple Volo.Abp.VirtualFileSystem from all dependencies of the Abp Framework
* Use Microsoft DependencyInjection instead of [AutoFac](https://autofac.org/)
* Add a workaround, so that `VirtualFileProvider` will also find existing directories returned from `PhysicalFileProvider`. This means, that `VirtualFileProvider` behaves the same, never mind whether files are retrieved using `EmbeddedFileProvider` or `PhysicalFileProvider`.
* Change of namespaces
